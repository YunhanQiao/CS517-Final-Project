To solve the vertex cover problem for the given graph, we need to identify the smallest set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set.

First, let's parse the edge-list format to construct the graph:

- Vertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
- Edges: (2, 9), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 5), (3, 9), (3, 10), (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 10), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 8), (8, 9)

Next, let's attempt to find a minimum vertex cover:

1. **Identify high-degree vertices**: These vertices are likely to cover many edges. From the list, vertex 9 appears frequently.
2. **Select vertex 9**: This vertex covers edges (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (8, 9). This leaves edges (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 10), (3, 10), (4, 6), (4, 10), (5, 10), (6, 10), (7, 8).
3. **Select vertex 10**: This vertex covers edges (1, 10), (3, 10), (4, 10), (5, 10), (6, 10). This leaves edges (1, 3), (1, 6), (4, 6), (7, 8).
4. **Select vertex 1**: This vertex covers edges (1, 3), (1, 6). This leaves edges (4, 6), (7, 8).
5. **Select vertex 6**: This vertex covers edge (4, 6). This leaves edge (7, 8).
6. **Select vertex 7 or 8**: Either will cover the remaining edge (7, 8).

Through this process, we have selected vertices {1, 6, 7, 9, 10} as a cover. Let's verify if we can reduce this set:

- **Check if we can remove vertices**: Removing any vertex from this cover set would leave at least one edge uncovered, indicating this is likely minimal.

Final answer:
Minimum vertex cover size: 5
Cover set: {1, 6, 7, 9, 10}

Confidence: 95%
