To solve the vertex cover problem for the given graph, we need to find the smallest set of vertices such that each edge in the graph has at least one endpoint in this set.

First, let's interpret the provided graph data:

The edge-list format suggests the following edges:
- (1, 3)
- (3, 4)
- (1, 2)
- (2, 4)
- (4, 5)

Let's analyze the graph:

1. **List of Vertices**: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
2. **List of Edges**: {(1, 3), (3, 4), (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 5)}

**Step-by-step reasoning to find the minimum vertex cover:**

1. **Start with high-degree vertices**: Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 3, 2, and 5. Covering vertex 4 will cover edges (3, 4), (2, 4), and (4, 5).

2. **Cover remaining edges**: After including vertex 4, the remaining uncovered edges are (1, 3) and (1, 2). Including vertex 1 will cover both these edges.

3. **Verify the cover**: 
   - With vertices {1, 4}, we cover all the edges:
     - (1, 3) is covered by vertex 1.
     - (3, 4) is covered by vertex 4.
     - (1, 2) is covered by vertex 1.
     - (2, 4) is covered by vertex 4.
     - (4, 5) is covered by vertex 4.

4. **Check for smaller cover**: 
   - Attempting to find a smaller cover than {1, 4} would leave some edges uncovered, as removing either vertex 1 or 4 leaves at least one edge without coverage.

Therefore, the minimum vertex cover size is 2, and the set of vertices that form this cover is {1, 4}.

Final answer:
Minimum vertex cover size: 2
Cover set: {1, 4}
Confidence: 95%
