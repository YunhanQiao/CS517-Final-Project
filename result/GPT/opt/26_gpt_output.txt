===== GPT Response =====
To solve the vertex cover problem for the given graph, let's first interpret the edge-list format provided:

Vertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10}
Edges: 
- (1, 3), (1, 4)
- (2, 7)
- (2, 5), (2, 6)
- (4, 6), (4, 10)
- (5, 10)

Now, let's determine the minimum vertex cover:

1. **Identify edges with unique vertices**: 
   - Edge (2, 7) involves vertex 7, which is not included in any other edge. Therefore, vertex 7 must be in the vertex cover to cover the edge (2, 7).

2. **Cover edges by selecting vertices**:
   - By selecting vertex 7, edge (2, 7) is covered.
   - To cover edge (1, 3) and (1, 4), we can select vertex 1. This covers both edges.
   - To cover edges (2, 5) and (2, 6), since vertex 2 is already involved in these edges, selecting vertex 2 will cover both edges.
   - To cover edge (4, 6) and (4, 10), selecting vertex 4 will cover both edges.
   - Edge (5, 10) is covered by selecting either vertex 5 or 10. Since vertex 5 is already involved in edge (2, 5), selecting vertex 5 will cover this edge as well.

3. **Verify and optimize**:
   - By selecting vertices {1, 2, 4, 7, 5}, all edges are covered.
   - Attempt to reduce the set: Removing any vertex leaves at least one edge uncovered. Hence, this set is minimal.

Final answer:
Minimum vertex cover size: 5
Cover set: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}

Confidence: 95%
