To solve this vertex cover problem, we need to determine the smallest set of vertices that includes at least one endpoint of every edge in the graph. Let's break down the problem based on the provided edge-list format.

First, let's interpret the edge-list format:
- The first line indicates 10 vertices and 7 edges.
- The subsequent lines list the edges for each vertex.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **List all edges:**
   - From the edge-list, we can reconstruct the edges:
     - Vertex 1 connects to 2, 5, 7, 9
     - Vertex 2 connects to 1, 6, 7, 9, 10
     - Vertex 3 connects to 4, 7
     - Vertex 4 connects to 3, 5, 7, 9
     - Vertex 5 connects to 1, 4, 6
     - Vertex 6 connects to 2, 5
     - Vertex 7 connects to 1, 2, 3, 4
     - Vertex 8 connects to 10
     - Vertex 9 connects to 1, 2, 4, 10
     - Vertex 10 connects to 2, 8, 9

   From this, we can list the unique edges:
   - (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 9)
   - (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 10)
   - (3, 4), (3, 7)
   - (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9)
   - (5, 6)
   - (8, 10)

2. **Select vertices for the cover:**
   - We need to cover all edges. A strategic way is to first cover high-degree vertices.
   - Vertex 2 has connections to 5 edges: (1, 2), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 10).
   - Vertex 7 covers: (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7).
   - If we choose vertex 2 and vertex 7, we cover many edges.

3. **Verify coverage:**
   - By selecting vertices 2 and 7, we cover the following edges:
     - (1, 2), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 10), (1, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7)
   - Remaining edges to cover: (1, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (8, 10)
   - To cover (1, 5), (4, 5), and (5, 6), we add vertex 5.
   - To cover (3, 4), we add vertex 4.
   - To cover (8, 10), we add vertex 10.

4. **Final Vertex Cover:**
   - Vertices selected: 2, 4, 5, 7, 10
   - These vertices cover all edges in the graph.

### Final Answer:
Minimum vertex cover size: 5  
Cover set: {2, 4, 5, 7, 10}

Confidence: 95%
