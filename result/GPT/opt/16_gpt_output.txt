To solve this vertex cover problem, we need to identify a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in this set. We aim to find the minimum such set.

The graph is provided in an adjacency list format, which we interpret as follows:

Vertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Edges:
- (1, 8), (1, 10)
- (2, 4), (2, 10)
- (3, 8), (3, 9)
- (4, 2)
- (5, 9)
- (6, 8), (6, 9)
- (7, 10)

Let's analyze the graph step-by-step:

1. **List all edges:**
   - From the adjacency list, we extract the edges:
     (1, 8), (1, 10), (2, 4), (2, 10), (3, 8), (3, 9), (5, 9), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 10)

2. **Select vertices to cover edges:**
   - Start with high-degree vertices, as they connect to many edges.
   - Vertex 8 connects to vertices 1, 3, and 6. Cover edges: (1, 8), (3, 8), (6, 8).
   - Vertex 10 connects to vertices 1, 2, and 7. Cover edges: (1, 10), (2, 10), (7, 10).
   - Vertex 9 connects to vertices 3, 5, and 6. Cover edges: (3, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9).

3. **Verify coverage:**
   - After selecting vertices 8, 10, and 9, let's check the remaining edges:
     - (2, 4) is not covered.
   - Add vertex 2 to cover (2, 4).

4. **Check if the solution is minimal:**
   - We have selected vertices {2, 8, 9, 10}. 
   - Removing any of these vertices leaves some edges uncovered, so this set is minimal.

Final answer:
Minimum vertex cover size: 4
Cover set: {2, 8, 9, 10}

Confidence: 95%
