To solve the vertex cover problem for the given graph, we need to find the smallest set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in this set.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Graph Structure:**
   - From the edge-list format, we interpret the vertices and edges:
     - Vertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
     - Edges: (4,6), (4,10), (4,5), (6,9), (1,2), (3,5), (6,8), (3,4), (7,9), (5,10)

2. **Covering Strategy:**
   - We need to cover all edges using the minimum number of vertices.
   - Start by identifying vertices with high degrees or those that are part of multiple critical edges.

3. **Vertex Degree Analysis:**
   - Vertex 4: Connected to 6, 10, 5, and 3 (4 edges)
   - Vertex 6: Connected to 4, 9, and 8 (3 edges)
   - Vertex 5: Connected to 4, 3, and 10 (3 edges)
   - Other vertices are connected to fewer edges.

4. **Initial Covering:**
   - Choose vertex 4 as it covers the most edges initially (4 edges: (4,6), (4,10), (4,5), (3,4)).
   - After choosing vertex 4, the edges (4,6), (4,10), (4,5), and (3,4) are covered.

5. **Cover Remaining Edges:**
   - Remaining edges to cover: (6,9), (1,2), (3,5), (6,8), (7,9), (5,10).
   - Choose vertex 6 to cover edges (6,9) and (6,8).
   - Choose vertex 5 to cover edges (3,5) and (5,10).

6. **Verification:**
   - Check if all edges are covered: 
     - (4,6) - covered by 4
     - (4,10) - covered by 4
     - (4,5) - covered by 4
     - (6,9) - covered by 6
     - (1,2) - not yet covered
     - (3,5) - covered by 5
     - (6,8) - covered by 6
     - (3,4) - covered by 4
     - (7,9) - not yet covered
     - (5,10) - covered by 5
   - Remaining edges (1,2) and (7,9) need additional vertices.

7. **Complete the Cover:**
   - Choose vertex 1 to cover edge (1,2).
   - Choose vertex 9 to cover edge (7,9).

8. **Final Vertex Cover:**
   - The vertices chosen are {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}.

Final answer:
Minimum vertex cover size: 5
Cover set: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
Confidence: 90%
