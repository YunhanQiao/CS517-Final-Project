To solve the vertex cover problem, we need to find the smallest set of vertices such that every edge in the graph has at least one endpoint in this set.

Let's analyze the given graph:

Vertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

Edges (extracted from the adjacency list):
- (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9)
- (2, 5)
- (2, 4)
- (2, 3)
- (3, 9)
- (4, 10)
- (5, 10)

Steps to find the minimum vertex cover:

1. **Identify high-degree vertices**: 
   - Vertex 1 has the highest degree (4), covering edges (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), and (1, 9). Including vertex 1 in the cover will cover these 4 edges.

2. **Cover remaining edges**:
   - After including vertex 1, the edges (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 9), (4, 10), and (5, 10) remain uncovered.
   - Vertex 2 covers three edges: (2, 5), (2, 4), and (2, 3).
   - Including vertex 2 covers these edges.

3. **Check remaining uncovered edges**:
   - The edges (4, 10) and (5, 10) remain uncovered.
   - Vertex 10 connects to vertices 4 and 5, covering both remaining edges.

4. **Verify minimality**:
   - The set {1, 2, 10} covers all edges.
   - Removing any vertex from this set will leave at least one edge uncovered, confirming it is minimal.

Final answer:
Minimum vertex cover size: 3
Cover set: {1, 2, 10}

Confidence: 95%
